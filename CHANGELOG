# CHANGELOG
#

# 1.7
Creates titles for dialogs: "Information dialog" and "Error dialog"

Now UFT can differ between an error and an information:
  JavaDialog("Information dialog").JavaButton("OK").Click
  JavaDialog("Error dialog").JavaButton("OK").Click

Add a CHANGELOG file.

# 1.8
Restructuring the storage method (for customer)

Reset button and double entry error works better; new structure (application/Controller)
Enter saves the customer details (application/DetailsTab).
Removes empty fields (in Customer class) and add clone method (application/objects/Customer).
Add README information about VM params. Spaces at the beginning and at the end are ignored (README).
Swap old jar to new one (Version 1.8).
